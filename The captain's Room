# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

# If I create a counter for the list and create a for loop to check the value wich is going to be zero I will get the answer because all the rest of the values will be equal to k.

# If countedList.values() != k then return that value

#How can I use the inputs in my code as a List

from collections import Counter
